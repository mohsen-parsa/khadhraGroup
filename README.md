Team Profile:
Commercial and  proposal manager: Ahmad Ahmadi Rad
 
Khadhar Team has great enjoyment in submitting a proposal to the Public health care (PHC) projects. We have a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in each area critical to the success of PHC domain. We implemented like this clinic management system for Hakimol Bironi Clinic and we have skill in areas reception accounting, drug store management, laboratory, operation and surgery room’s management with all aspects of requirements and crisis in PHC domain. We have clear understanding of the requirement set out by official and governmental with international standards, restrictions and rules. For our full team expertise and background please refer to URL that mentioned on the top of proposal.
Qods clinic requirements:
According to our experience in public health care domain, clinic, and interview that we had with Mr. Saedi and visiting from Qods clinic. Khadhra team understood the requirements to be as such:
1-  Data reporting and analyzing
2-	Calculating incomes and Budget reporting
3-	Stock and expenditure report
4-	Laboratory  testing results
5-	Patients information report
6-	Lack of using database and back up from information
7-	Operation room data report
Our proposed management system and design is such that it will give the report of all patients, patient services, making decision and solution of your daily problem, such us better services to people,  and also  stock reporting link, getting information about your everyday drug sales ,visited doctors , descriptions, personnel reporting, Operation treatments,  patients payment, drug repository reporting in time scale of  daily , monthly , yearly reporting. On the other hand also laboratory reporting give the information like result reporting and time of report. In patients information you are able to get the all information about your patients including dates and times he/she arrived. It’s also capable of securing by restricting access to the data in your database. In operation treatment, the software gives description of your Operations, available rooms, which doctor is in charge, patient’s payment and what kind of operation they had at what time.
Software subsystems:
We divide the system in four, each subsystem divide to some other components. At first the reception phase is necessary because, it is like a core and we register the patients and save information about them. Print the recipe for patient and calculate incoming costs. The second subsystem is drug store and store, we can save about buying of new drugs, when they sold the system will report that how many of the drug was sold and calculate the incoming and other expenditures. The third subsystem which is laboratory the software will register the patients and save the information of patient’s test and give a result sheet as output. In operation subsystem which is the fourth, the software will manage the operation room’s scheduling and reporting like information about the price of room and kind of operation and doctor who was in charge of operation in database and calculate the cost and percentage of doctor and clinic. By availing itself of our proposed management system and design, Qods clinic will:
1-	Secure data storing
2-	Data reporting and analyzing
3-	Ease of work
4-	Maintenance support
5-	Reliable database
6-	Time saving
7-	Better management
8-	fast Searching capability
9-	Patient satisfaction
10-	Ease of use 
Project cost estimation: 
The following cost summary has been developed as estimation associated with the proposed solution. Based on acceptance of this proposal, our team will work with you to develop a detailed list of requirements, develop your tailored solution, and provide a more focused and applicable cost certainty.
As mentioned we have four system in this software package and in each subsystem we need experts mentioned in below tables and their salary so we need 3600 $ per each phase that totally it become 14600 $ to finish the project in expected timeline. 
no	Subsystem	                          Effective cost
1	Reception subsystem	                  3600
2	Drug store subsystem	                3600
3	Operation room subsystem	            3600
4	Laboratory subsystem	                3600

Skill requirement:
No	Skill	                        Number	        Salary
1	Programmer	                   2	              9 $ / hour
2	Database designer	             2	              12 $ /hour
3	Software engineer	             2	              10 $ /hour

Our methodology:
The Khadhra team proudly can say we have confident on our own abilities to provide effective Project Management and offer a complete solution in approach of customer’s requirements, we are aware of your human resource limitations, cost concern, so we will provide means of achieving major cost savings. We will integrate proven technologies and tools available in standard markets listed below.
1-	In business logic we will use java technology 
2-	In graphic and user interface we also use java technology
3-	In data and information storing we will use mysql
4-	In hardware technology for tracking the material we will use both manually and barcode reader possibly.

For product support first we will train you working with software and during one year after run, we will support our product and fix any debug reported. The design will be based on development such you can see the software product demo sequentially in very small units of time, possibly every week. Thus you can advise your changes in details of software product.   

The proposed solution by Khadhra team uses a combination of not complex, but tried and tested tools, and we are aware of copyright, legislative and judiciary aspects of official organizations. Thus we use free but very secure and most popular software development tools available on the market.
Khadhra team is therefore confident and guarantees that the proposed approach will provide the most reliable convenient and efficient software system at the top of market place, which will bring significant, improve on a timescale and within a budget that can be agreed and achieved. Having duly examined your requirements, we are confident that our proposed approach will effectively address your needs.
